# odin-recipies

My current project is to make a webiste for a few recipies. I hope to demonstrate my ability to create a webpage even a basic one without doing copy and paste. It said we will revisit this once we have learned some CSS so I'm hoping to make visually appealing. I'm not sure at this time if we will include JS however I will do my best with HTML and CSS.
