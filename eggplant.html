    <h1>Fried Eggplant and Tomatoes</h1>

    <p>At this time I have no photo of this dish nor can I find one online as it is a family recipie</p>


    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is one of those family recipies where there are not always exact measurements. The dish consists of fried eggplants 
         and pan fired tomamtoes. The tomatoes I personally have not mastered and am still working ont the recipie. This can be a little
        time consuming but well worth it in the end.</p>
